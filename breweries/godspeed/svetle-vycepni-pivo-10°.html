Back in November 2018, Our brewmaster was selected to be part of a Czech Republic Trade Mission hosted by the Czech American Embassy and Canadian Consulate Economic &amp; Trade Sections. This trip was such a revelation and by far far one of our brewmaster‘s best beer trips ever. 

Godspeed‘s fascination for the Czech Brewing philosophy and culture is growing day by day. This Světlé Výčepní Pivo 10º is only the begining of a long journey and friendship with the Czech brewing culture and people. We are now studying and sourcing some of the finest Czech raw materials for designing our new Czech Lagers made with the true Czech brewing philosophy. 

We’ve never been that excited! 

Na Zdraví!
