Back in 2017, after years of planning, set backs, red tape, and construction, the first brew day arrived.

Put up against today&#39;s current struggle - for front line healthcare and shop workers, the sick, and quarantined, we contend that the making of this beer was its own luxury.  

This version of Kur≈ç has a similar approach to its predecessor: baker&#39;s chocolate, hazelnut, faint coffee roast and dry finish, but we&#39;ve gone ahead and presented this iteration in nitro form. Each can pours jet black with a billowing, cascading lurch of mocha-coloured foam that enlivens the beer&#39;s silken texture and baffles it&#39;s rich, malty depth. As in Japanese philosophy (Godai), we echoed the five elements (earth, water, fire, wind, void) with five different beer labels, each playing off a central theme.  

Pour vigorously and enjoy!
