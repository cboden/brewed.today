What are lees? They‚Äôre what‚Äôs left over after a wine fermentation (mostly yeast and some grape materials - looks like brown sludge, tastes like magic chalk candy). The Chardonnay lees we used for this beer were very ‚Äúwet‚Äù - meaning they contained a lot of juicy grape material (aka wine). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to the stainless-steel aging (no oxygen ingress) and a 6-month bottle conditioning repose, Lees is squeaky clean, very fruity, and youthfully bright for a beer of its age.
