You don‚Äôt have to blaze a trail to get somewhere nice and new. With the sun beating bright overhead, now is one of those moments to let a warm breeze guide you. Inviting the spirited and vibrant elements of Cuba into a beloved German standard, the Mojito Radler is for those who are ready to happen upon a pleasant new path. 

When brewers Jacob and Tomas decided on a summer radler offering, they knew they wanted to inspire new appreciation for an old tradition. The experience took them from Germany to Cuba‚Äîand away from any of the usual ingredients associated with the summer shandy. They landed on the Mojito Radler, a bold move with a light taste. 

Notes of lime mingle with hints of mint before ending on a light yet satisfying finish in this pleasantly refreshing and subtle beer that, at 2.4%, is low in alcohol. 

The Mojito Radler is for the beer and non-beer drinkers alike who seek a fresh take on an easy summer classic.
