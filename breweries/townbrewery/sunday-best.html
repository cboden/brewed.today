We leaned on Simcoe Cryo to jam the whirlpool with more hops than we&#39;ve ever put in a beer, then elevated that with a heavy dose of Phantasm powder to enhance the fruity thiols, and fermented it escarpment labs Thiol Libre to release those bad boys. The result is an intense hop bomb that&#39;s like a big &#39;ol slap to the face of all your six senses. The white wine character in this beer is unbelievable and it&#39;s followed up by enormous stone fruit and candied citrus. The body is big and the flavour is powerful. It&#39;s a potent lil&#39; buddy and we think you&#39;ll love it.
