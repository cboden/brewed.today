We&#39;ve typically loved to make (and drink) beers that smack you in the face with flavour. Those types of beers won&#39;t be going anywhere, but it has been challenging and gratifying to continue to work and evolve our lager process and you can bet they&#39;ll be a staple in our fridges as well. Fidelity is a super crisp pilsner that was intended to be a portrait of the current state of our lager program and a culmination of 18 different lager recipes. Instead it feels like a beer that represents the start of the next level of our lager production and the beginning of something special.
