We connected with the legends¬†at Sawdust City to discuss brewing a beer together, and talked concepts and ideas. We decided to do two collabs (home and home), and we&#39;d use the same single malt and the same single hop to create two drastically different beers. At that point we brought the experts @brewculture into the fold and collectively landed on Raven Pilsner malt and a fairly new hop called Vista from @yakimachief. Just a classic case of some good people getting together, based on their love of good beers, trying to make something interesting that y&#39;all will enjoy - Wicked Humans Pilsner was the outcome. It&#39;s a bit of a mash up considering the Czech malt, American hops and German yeast but are we ever pleased. The floor malted Raven pils gives this unique layered complexity and the vista really shines as a dual purpose hop - with clean bitterness some subtle citrus and green tea vibes. Big thanks to Sam and Dan for making this happen.
