It&#39;s no surprise that we&#39;ve been big fans of Alt-Country legends Elliott Brood for some time...you can often hear their tunes playing on any given day in the taproom and we&#39;ve also presented local shows of theirs in the past. We approached them about creating a beer together and it just so happened that they were preparing to release a new album titled - TOWN. Boom... match made in heaven. Seeing as how stouts are a favourite beer style of the band, generally fun to make and on-point seasonally - the choice was clear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dark End of the Road is a 5.6% Stout aptly named after our favourite song on this new record. There&#39;s no adjuncts or fluff, just the goods. This beer has layers and layers of malt flavour highlighted by chocolate, light roast coffee and dark honey undertones. It coats your entire pallet on the sip but finishes dry with almost zero roast or smokiness. It&#39;s a beautiful beer to enjoy while welcoming in winter, and it&#39;s available now at the brewery!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5.6% alc.&#x2F;vol."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/2ceceb601235a375d39acc42d1667f71.eb9b52c5.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/townbrewery/dark-end-of-the-road"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - Dark End Of The Road"><meta property="og:description" content="We have a very special release for you all today!
