Halcyon will lure you to the sour side with this approachable, lightly tart and refreshing sour, Echo Chamber. The recipe highlights a single organic hop variety, Idaho 7. Dry-hopped sours are a relative newcomer in modern brewing. The late-addition hopping contributes the citrus fruit aromas, which naturally are complemented by the refreshing acidity of a sour. Echo Chamber pours a hazy straw gold with a bit of foam. The aroma moves into citrus with faint grassy hay notes in the background. The beer is very tart to begin then gradually softens to balanced acidity. Fruity tang throughout adds to the refreshing nature of the beer. Echo Chamber finishes dry with a little bit of barrel tannin rounding out the finish."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/376dfdb96a9a2aceb51bd0212315e6c6.dcc9da8e.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/beaus/echo-chamber"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - Echo Chamber"><meta property="og:description" content="Halcyon Barrel House is a branch on the Beau&#39;s family tree.
