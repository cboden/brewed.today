P.A. that goes low on the alcohol, but still delivers refreshing hoppy aromas and satisfying full-bodied flavour. Brewed with organic nelson sauvin and centennial hops, the recipe adds wheat and oats to barley malts for an easy-to-enjoy and uncompromising craft beer experience.  A session I. P.A. is a lower-alcohol expression of an India Pale Ale that highlights approachable hop aroma and flavour, without intense bitterness. The hop-derived citrus and tropical fruit notes lead into a fuller mouthfeel than might otherwise be expected from a light ale. Good Time Session I. P.A. pours gold with white foam. The aroma offers a combination of citrus, gooseberry, pineapple flavours and aromas. The flavour is juicy with subtle hop bitterness. The body is light and refreshing. The finish is clean and lingeringly hoppy. Pair with honey-roasted peanuts, corn dogs, mild cheeses."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/bcb3e080a0874ee5bb439a0144c2f94f.d7c30e95.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/beaus/good-time-session-ipa"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - Good Time Session I.P.A."><meta property="og:description" content="Good Time is a session I.
