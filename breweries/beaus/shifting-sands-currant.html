 Shifting Sands Currant pours a deep pinkish-red, with soft pink foam that retreats quickly. The aroma is dominated by herbal, fruity and peppery black currant, echoed by a hint of wine. The first sip is upfront acidity, transporting fruity currant goodness and a light spicy character. With spritzy carbonation, moderate tannins help dry out a finish that lingers sour and sweet.
