What’s a cold IPA? Even though we’re calling it an India Pale Ale (IPA), it’s actually a (hopped up) lager, because we fermented it with a lager yeast. The base beer is an American adjunct lager using corn, which was matured in tank at just above the freezing point. To give it those IPA vibes, we then generously dry-hopped with Idaho 7, Simcoe and Hallertau Blanc. It has more bitterness than a traditional American lager but it’s very smooth and refreshing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The result is a bright, hop-forward, crisp beer that’ll have you ready for patio season. The light colour may be deceiving, as this beer is bold in it’s hop expression. On the nose, you’ll pick up dank, resinous pine, bright citrus, with a herbal finish. The tasting notes include peach, mango, ripe orange and grapefruit rind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6.8% ABV &#x2F; 355mL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ingredients: water, barley, corn, yeast, Idaho 7, Simcoe &amp; Hallertau Blanc hops."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/05a1d62e47109e9394797e0b5f1c78b6.c36ac2cd.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/grainandgrit/cold-call"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - Cold Call"><meta property="og:description" content="It’s not too often new beer styles come along, so we’re very excited to introduce Cold Call, our first cold IPA.
