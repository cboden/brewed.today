Well this is not exactly how we pictured unveiling our anniversary beer this year but we&#39;ll make the best of it! Our beloved anniversary triple dry-hopped double IPA is brewed with plenty of oats, wheat and lactose sugar and hopped with Citra, Mosaic, Galaxy and El Dorado. Notes of mango and tangerine, with pineapple, tropical fruit and a hint of pine. Highlighting a smoothie-like texture, with a soft bitterness and a bit of sweetness. We take this yearly opportunity to revel in such an indulgent beer, and believe it&#39;s as much as anyone could wish for on their birthday.
