Brewed in April using 100% Canadian ingredients, this Belgian Dark Strong ale was made entirely using maple sap sourced from Perry Sound instead of water. Fermented with our house Abbey yeast, it was also finished with maple syrup from the same producer and rested on toasted sugar maple wood and oak. Heritage hops from Prince Edward County add a very pleasant and delicate earthy, floral, and slightly herbaceous bouquet. With deep hints of maple and spice, it has a supple velvety texture and caramel like roundness without being at all overly sweet. Packing layers and layers of complexity and a gentle warming heat, Sugar Shack is best enjoyed at cellar temperatures around 10-13¬∞C.&lt;br&gt;After years of talking about making this, and many months of work and waiting for it to age to perfection, we are so excited to finally be releasing this absolutely gorgeous beer. Drink it no or keep some in the cellar."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/758af1363289fce99b668680e27a8121.45b6969e.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/shacklands/sugar-shack"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - Sugar Shack"><meta property="og:description" content="8.2% ABV355ml canBelgian Dark Strong Ale brewed with maple sap&lt;br&gt;Can conditioned&lt;br&gt;This is something both sumptuous and very very special.
