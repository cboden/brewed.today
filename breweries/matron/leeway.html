We wanted to brew another West Coast inspired beer, featuring Pleasant Valley (PEC hop farm) Centennial, Chinook and Cascade hops BUT we have also been pining for a new crispy yet flavourful lager. We wanted the best of two different worlds... so naturally we decided to combine them. We brewed a beer using only barley (no adjunct grains, all Bare Owl Malt), hopped it judiciously in the kettle and fermented it with our house lager yeast at slightly elevated temperature to let the fruitiness of the hops come out while still finishing crisp and clean. We dry-hopped it generously while not being obnoxious and added some actively fermenting lagerbier in a process called &quot;krausening&quot; to naturally carbonate the beer. It was conditioned nice and cold for several more weeks until it was bright and beautiful. We honestly didn&#39;t know what call this beer... Hoppy Lager? Sure... IPL? Naw, didn&#39;t really ring our bells. While we were trying to figure this out, we came across a podcast discussing Cold IPAs with Wayfinder Beer from Portland. It dawned on us that this is basically what we brewed without knowing it.

The bright citrus carries through to the pallet with a more restrained floral and pineapple character. An all-malt body is balanced with a well structured bitterness that leads to a curiously clean finish. Like it just ends, clean, crisp and dry.
