Each June we brew something special in celebration of our birthday!  Typically, we get to enjoy it all together at a classic Royal City Birthday Bash, but this year we&#39;ve decided to brew something bright &amp; fruity, complex &amp; herbaceous and big &amp; boozy and make it available for delivery and pickup so you can cheers with us from a safe distance in your home. 

This Pale Ale is made with Gewurztraminer juice and fermented with voss kveik and old world saison yeast. It has aromas of lemon, orange peel, lychee, roses, bread dough, bubble gum and fresh cut grass. On the palate, you&#39;ll find notes of candied orange and lychee as well as herbaceous and grassy flavours that blend to make a refreshing harmony! This beer is to be enjoyed with social distancing,  tacos al pastor and a big THANK YOU for all your support and kindness over the last 6 years!
