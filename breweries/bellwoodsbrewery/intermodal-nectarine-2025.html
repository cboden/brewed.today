This 100% spontaneously inoculated wild beer was created in a style inspired by traditional lambic producers (funky, bright, vinous brews that originated in Belgium in the 13th century). &lt;br&gt;In most modern breweries, fermentation happens in closed environments to keep out bacteria and prevent off-flavours. But with spontaneous fermentation beers like Intermodal, we invite wild yeast and bacteria from the air.&lt;br&gt;Each fall, during a narrow window of specific cool overnight temperatures (10-15C), we fill our open-air coolship (which is a broad, open vessel) with hot wort and let it rest and cool overnight. During this time, wild yeast and microorganisms floating in the air are introduced to the beer, rather than us adding a lab yeast.&lt;br&gt;Next, we transfer the wort into neutral, steam-sanitized and hand-scrubbed barrels that have no living organisms left in the wood, where it sits for a long time. Sometimes a year, sometimes three, but it’s not a passive period: our brewers are constantly monitoring and topping up the barrels as wild yeast continues to shape the beer. Once we decide it’s tasting how we want (well balanced in acidity and character), we bottle and bring these beers to you. It’s archaic, inefficient, and a little silly—but that’s the point. It’s beer made the romantic way.&lt;br&gt;Intermodal 2025 is a blend of one- and three-year-old barrels. It’s low in acidity which makes it easier to drink and a great introduction to sour beer. We split it into two tart, funky, extra-bubbly batches: one aged on its own, and one aged with Ontario nectarines from Warner’s Farm that were processed by our very own staff, by hand.&lt;br&gt;Good things come to those who wait, and these beers have been waiting for you!"><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/a5ae7c41e667d2f58aeedeebfadec9d3.3eaf2d4a.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/bellwoodsbrewery/intermodal-nectarine-2025"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - Intermodal Nectarine (2025)"><meta property="og:description" content="Our highly-awaited Intermodal is here for another season!
