A beer that pays tribute to the Chinese workers who helped build Canada’s railway system. The railway has long been a vital connection between east and west, transporting goods from shipping ports to warehouses across the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This unique brew starts with our award-winning Line 12 Lager with Szechuan peppercorns and a touch of dried orange peel added. The peppercorns add a subtle berry-like hint rather than heat, while the orange lends a light, candied citrus note. Perfect on its own or paired with your favourite Asian dish.
