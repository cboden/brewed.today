This Package includes 3 books, each paired with one of our beers (2 of each style for 6 beers total):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Hidden Keys by Andre Alexis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(A literary mystery that is centered around Parkdale and Rosedale in Toronto)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paired with Diamond Park Mild. Named after the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team’s third stadium that stood in Liberty Village on Fraser and Liberty. It’s a dark full-flavoured session ale with notes of toffee and toast that finishes with enough body to satisfy but dry enough to refresh at the same time.  This beer is very faithful to the style and honours English brewing traditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Nostalgia by David Berry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Just published, a fascinating history of nostalgia from medical diagnosis for homesick soldiers to the cultural&#x2F;political term it&#39;s become.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paired with The Little Sipper Session IPA. Gazing at the stars is a way of looking back in time.  The light from those stars began its journey well before we laid eyes on it.  This beer is named for its incredible constellation of 5 amazing American &quot;C&quot; hops; Chinook, Citra, Cascade, Copper and Centennial.  The result is an easy drinking beer that is full of pine and grapefruit aromas and the balanced bitterness and malt character you&#39;d expect from a much bigger beer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;POP by Simina Banu &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(A very fun debut collection of poetry about heartbreak and junkfood.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paired with Helles Island Lager.   This Munich style light lager is brewed with all Michigan Hops.
