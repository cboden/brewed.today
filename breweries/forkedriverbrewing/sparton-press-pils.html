It&#39;s our classic Pilsner, this time dry hopped with some of your fave American hops. We dry hopped with Cascade, Amarillo and Mosaic and used more Mosaic and Citra in the kettle.

We partnered up with our good friends at Speed City Records on this one. They&#39;re celebrating their 25th anniversary, and the new can art commemorates the occasion! We&#39;ve also got forkin&#39; awesome branded slip mats for your turntable!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;473mL - 4.7%ABV - Delicious!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fun fact, Sparton Records operated in London, pressing records up until 1969 after they were bought out by ABC Records the previous year.
