No mean feat for an over 11% imperial stout. ReForest Kelley is an out-of-this world experience and took a lot of work to push it towards its tartness- as well as taking an awful lot of patience! Who else is putting a beer like this in bourbon barrels for over 18 months, as well as incorporating locally-sourced fruit to add to its complex flavour?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big, bold, oaky, and sour with a background cherry finish- this beer brings together elements from across the universe of brewing to yield a careful blend of flavours. The base beer is our national gold medal-winning bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout Weendigo, to which we added sour cultures and Ontario black cherries sourced from Heeman’s just down the road.  And oodles of bourbon flavour? Yeah, it’s got that too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ready to explore some brave new worlds and seek out new beer experiences? Your mission is clear- come by the retail store for a sample in our tasting room, and bring home a bottle to enjoy at home."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/3cd5376ba81dc041aa7591b4c3ac7dcc.62e1efae.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/forkedriverbrewing/reforest-kelley"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - ReForest Kelley"><meta property="og:description" content="Yes, Bones, it’s gloriously sour.
