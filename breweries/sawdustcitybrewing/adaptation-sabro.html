Whenever we get a new hop in, we really want to see how it presents in a beer. Sometimes what you smell in a hop rub doesn‚Äôt always translate to the finished product. So in order to get the real flavour and aromas, we need to brew a beer that will showcase the hop. This is why we started the Adaptation series a few years back, to use a blank canvas to showcase each hop. Seeing how Sabro has been the new ‚Äòit hop‚Äô over the last year or so, we decided to give it the ‚ÄòAdaptation treatment‚Äô to show you what all the fuss is about.
