Teaming up with the good folks at Malivoire Winery, Love, Sweet Love is a true beer-wine hybrid. Fermented in stainless on over 3.5 tons of Ontario grown merlot grapes and using a process called carbonic maceration, this beer bursts with lively aromas and flavours of fresh strawberry, rose petal and of course grape.
