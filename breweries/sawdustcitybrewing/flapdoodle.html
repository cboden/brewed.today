To complete this delicious blend of malt, we included some East Kent Goldings hops to stay in style, but then added some brand new “Most” hops from Charles Faram. This new variety brings hints of red fruit &amp; bubblegum; this should play well with the rich malt body and fruitiness of the London yeast.  Pouring an enticing clear and dark amber, this pint is meant to draw you in with its pristine colour and hint of fruity hops on the nose. Nothing is over powering, everything is just in balance.
