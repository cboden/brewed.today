Uranus by any other name would smell so sweet. That was written many eons ago by Toftorg Golshop, Ruler of the Third Empire of Uranus on one of his many voyages to earth (it was stolen and rewritten by “you know who” sometime later).And while on earth for one of those trips, Toftorg grew fond of the rich, robust stouts of Northern England. Designed to withstand the grueling voyage from Earth to Uranus, Long, Dark Voyage is an Uranal stout of the highest order. Tongue crushingly bitter and dry as a bone, this dark chocolate treat is quite dangerous and will sneak up on you from behind if you don’t keep your wits about you. Enjoy the decadence of Uranus with a friend. Great Divide&#39;s Yeti. This was the first beer that &quot;blew my little mind.&quot; I was in love with that beer. It made me want to brew a beer just like it. I just needed a place to do it. So when the opportunity came around to participate in the Iron Brewer Competition, I was given a “mystery bag” of ingredients. It was what was inside the bag that led me to brew an Imperial Stout. Along with all the malt and hops, one of the spices included in the bag was anise. So I decided to make an imperial stout with anise. Using the ingredients in the bag and Yeti as a template I put together the first LDV recipe. The original name of LDV was actually “Long, Dark Voyage to Ur-anise.&quot; The beer was pretty good. It finished 5th out of 20 or 30 entries. I was proud of it. I liked the beer, I liked the name but I did not like the anise. So I dropped the anise and went with Uranus. The rest, as they say, is history.</p> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.sawdustcitybrewing.com&#x2F;" rel="external" class="btn-primary">Shop Brewery</a> <div class="beer-details">
