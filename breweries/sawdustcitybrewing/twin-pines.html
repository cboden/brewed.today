If you like hops, and we know you do, you‚Äôre gonna wanna try the Twin Pines IIPA. It‚Äôs a  tribute to one of Sawdust City‚Äôs favourite Sci-fi flicks. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of the film or not, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre gonna love this irresponsibly hopped ale. 

Many moons ago when Lone Pine was first released, Zack from Toronto Brewing asked if the name was a Back to the Future reference. As soon as he said that, I so badly wished it was, but I had to regretfully tell him that no, it wasn‚Äôt. 

From that day forward, I vowed to tap into that reference and make an imperial version of Lone Pine and call it Twin Pines. It would take a few years (until we opened our space in Gravenhurst) but it eventually did happen. The release of Twin Pines and our embracing of the joke, eased my conscience and erased a grave mistake I felt I had made in the past. Kinda like going back to the future myself.
