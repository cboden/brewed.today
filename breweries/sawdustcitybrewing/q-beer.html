We&#39;ve given it ample time to lager, resulting in a super-smooth body with just a hint of nutty-maltiness to lead the way. It&#39;s balanced by subtle hop flavours, resulting in a light amber hue for an incredibly easy-drinking lager. A portion of all proceeds will support Muskoka Pride. 

Sam&#39;s Take On Q Beer: 

Each year at Sawdust City we look forward to Muskoka Pride Festival and the annual Summer Drag Show in the Saloon. While it may be some time before we can all congregate again, we&#39;re counting down the days until Muskoka Pride Week, with a new beer made with our friends at Muskoka Pride; “Q Beer Amber Lager.”  

We are excited to work with Muskoka Pride to support their initiatives and community outreach right here in Muskoka. President Merv Taylor-Morin offers, 

“We have a long standing partnership with Sawdust City as a sponsor, and host of our drag shows. We are so happy to have a beer that represents our relationship with the brewery and Muskoka.”
