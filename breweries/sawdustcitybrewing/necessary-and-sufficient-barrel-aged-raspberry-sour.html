Lightly carbonated, this beer accentuates a creamy body while the brilliant, white head floats atop a sea of red. Tart raspberry and oak greet you immediately, while a layer of funk meets you on the finish. This brew is very fruit forward, yet complex, and has a necessary amount of raspberries with the sufficient amount of funk to keep you on your toes. The golden ale was aging for almost 2 full years before we felt there was enough character for it to be ready. Unfortunately it had fermented out almost all the sugar and was very thin with a bit too much tannin. So we blended in some fresh belgian style session ale that had a good amount of body left and a big hop punch to add another layer of flavour. Lastly, we felt this would be a good candidate for a summer release if we added some fruit. We got some fresh raspberry juice and added it to the fermenter. The results are Necessary &amp; Sufficient (Cal came up with that name).
