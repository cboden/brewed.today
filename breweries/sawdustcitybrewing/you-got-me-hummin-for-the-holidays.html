Leaving the Belgian styles we normally do, this year we are going to try our hand at a Farmhouse Christmas Ale. Utilizing a new hybrid saison&#x2F;kveik yeast from the Escarpment Yeast labs and lightening up the colour, this year’s offering is most certainly different from years past.  With a fruity and spicy yeast driven aroma, a blend of 5 different malts, and some fun new hops, there is definitely lots to feel merry for about this special holiday release. Pouring a dusty unfiltered orange, it has a fluffy white head with aromas of spice, melon, apple and honey. The flavour has a ton of spice from the rye malt and saaz hops with a touch of bruised apple and fruit. The elevated ABV, gives a full bodied mouthfeel with a noticeable alcohol warming. A real holiday sipper to be enjoyed with family &amp; friends."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/bf443b511c66ea435909fab2cedad369.125b3f63.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/sawdustcitybrewing/you-got-me-hummin-for-the-holidays"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - You Got Me Hummin&#39; For The Holidays"><meta property="og:description" content="For the 5th installment of our collabo series with Eastbound Brewing, this year’s Sam &amp; Dave Christmas Ale is a decidedly different take than in years past.
