Using the simple malt body of a New England IPA and fermenting on Escarpment Labs Foggy London III Ale yeast we&#39;ve created a flavour that suggests more than the 4.8%abv you get. Finally, we dry-hopped Gnarnia with tons of Cashmere and Citra Cryo hops to give it a big citrus aroma and pack it with juicy flavour. 

Helping support local community groups is one of the things we love to do at Sawdust City. So when Roy and his cohorts at MORCA reached out to do a collabo with them to help fund and maintain their trails here in Muskoka, how could we say no?  They folks at MORCA wanted to create a beer that was perfect after a long ride on the trails. What we settled on, was a hop forward session ale that focused on aroma and flavour. Named after one of the trails here in Muskoka, Gnarnia does everything it promised.
