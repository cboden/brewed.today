Brewed in the Biere De Garde farmhouse style of Northern France, this year’s version is more approachable than in years past, with a malt forward body, a touch of barnyard funk and a slightly tart finish.

Sam&#39;s Take On Limberlost: 

Limberlost is always one of my favourite releases of the year. There’s always a bit of anticipation mixed with anxiety on how it’s going to turn out. I mean, this beer is a total crap shoot, it’s co-fermented with yeast from the forest for cryin’ out loud! But we’ve been very fortunate to have it work out each year. 

And over the years we’ve definitely gotten better at blending and packaging this beer to make sure the final product comes out  the way we intended. 

For this years’ version we wanted to try something completely different. We brewed a beer using all Canadian and local ingredients and then co-fermented it with our house ale yeast and our unique Limberlost strain, 100% in stainless steel.  In the past we’ve used oak aged beer that’s 100% spontaneously fermented. But this year we wanted to create a beer that was a little bit more  approachable, while still containing the unique Limberlost “flavour”. By focusing on the malt and having the yeast play a secondary role this year, your left with a layered beer that reveals itself slowly. Sip after sip. 

Limberlost is always a fun experiment and it’s a wonderful way for us as brewers to learn and grow as professionals each year.
