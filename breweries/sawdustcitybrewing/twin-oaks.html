We always really liked that brand, but as our pallets changed, we felt it could use a bit more body to help fill out the mouthfeel and make it slightly less astringent.

We felt the big oily mouthfeel of the west coast IIPA would give us the extra mouthfeel we were looking for. The results are fantastic. The extra body helps make the beer much more drinkable while also bringing a richer, more gold honey colour to the beer. The hops have mellowed, but they blend wonderfully with the fruit forward brett character of the barrel aged Princess."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/d7c7e06bbbb5d64a874a535e4a909ba1.5da4ce3d.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/sawdustcitybrewing/twin-oaks"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - Twin Oaks"><meta property="og:description" content="A barrel aged Belgian IPA blended with 35% fresh west coast IIPA…. but this isn’t about the hops!
