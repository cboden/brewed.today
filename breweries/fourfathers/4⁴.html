Being one of only 11 Trappist Breweries in the World (Trappist meaning a brewery run or overseen by Monks), they sadly closed their doors permanently in May. Upon arrival, they were greeted by Father William (the Abbot of the Monastery) and were taken on the very last tour and tasting of the large brewing facility. The most exciting part, we were lucky enough to acquire 4 freshly emptied barrels that previously aged the very last beer they produced! Our team then filled these barrels with a Belgium Quadrapel (Belgian Quadruple) and the aging process began! It’s now ready and the result is a beautiful Belgian Quadruple Aged in Trappist Barrels, with notes of vanilla, bourbon, caramel, soft spice and plum cake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Style: Belgian Quadruple Aged in Trappist Barrels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABV: 11.5%"><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/18e32a2338017904a715f93e64bff16d.840a7857.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/fourfathers/4⁴"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - 4⁴"><meta property="og:description" content="4⁴ celebrates our fourth anniversary at our location in the beautiful Hespeler Village!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On June 20th, our head brewer and one of the owners ventured on a 24-hour tour all the way to Spencer Brewery in Spencer, MA (just outside of Boston).
