Get lost in the haze and heat of our newest 174 release, Pineapple Habanero Hazy IPA.¬†&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pouring a wonderfully opaque dandelion yellow, with a dense layer of white foam.&lt;br&gt;The aroma of this beer is dominated by scents of¬†pineapple and citrus with hints of fresh clipped grass and slight peppery habanero spice. Upon first sip the sweetness of the pineapple and grainy malts are immediately apparent, followed by a spicy kick from the habanero peppers that lingers on the tongue. Despite it&#39;s sweetness, this beer has a smooth mouthfeel thanks to the hazy, unfiltered nature of the IPA. The Galaxy Hops add a tropical note that balances out the sweetness and spiciness of the beer creating a well-rounded flavour experience."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/3e3adc40935fcf89050e88f1e735eaa8.ffe42f54.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/broadhead/pineapple-habanero-hazy-ipa"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - PINEAPPLE HABANERO HAZY IPA"><meta property="og:description" content="ABV 5.5% | IBU 14 | SRM 6&lt;br&gt;Brewed in collaboration with our friend Chris Villeneuve of Junior &amp; The Kid, and inspired by ingredients¬†in his popular BBQ sauces.
