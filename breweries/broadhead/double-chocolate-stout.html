Brewed with both premium cacao nibs and milk chocolate, it presents a layered and decadent chocolate experience. The appearance is deep brown to near black, crowned by a persistent, dense mocha head.&lt;br&gt;The aroma is dominated by rich milk chocolate and toasted cacao, supported by a foundation of soft, roasted malt and a subtle nutty character from the single-origin nibs.&lt;br&gt;On the palate, a pronounced chocolate flavor is immediate, evolving into notes of dark cocoa and light coffee from carefully selected roasted malts. The lactose and chocolate additions build a rounded sweetness and full-bodied richness without being cloying. The mouthfeel is notably silky and full, with a velvety texture that carries the flavors to a clean finish marked by a gentle alcohol warmth and a lingering, pleasant sweetness.&lt;br&gt;Perfect for: After-dinner sipping, cool evenings, and pairing with vanilla-based desserts or sharp cheeses."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/892bba3e3fff4058570da7d4f3f3f9fe.9538cddd.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/broadhead/double-chocolate-stout"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - DOUBLE CHOCOLATE STOUT"><meta property="og:description" content="Double Chocolate Stout | 174 Series&lt;br&gt;8.0% ABV | 30 IBU | 37 SRM&lt;br&gt;Contains Lactose&lt;br&gt;Profile: Sweet Stout | Hops: Warrior | Adjuncts: Cacao Nibs, Milk Chocolate&lt;br&gt;Product Description:&lt;br&gt;This limited 174 Series release is a deliberate exploration of chocolate intensity.
