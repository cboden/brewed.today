There’s a delicate wheatiness underneath that brings it all together without&lt;br&gt;overpowering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flavor opens with bright, ripe peach followed by soft wheat and just a touch of sweetness. The addition of vanilla and lactose adds a creamy, rounded finish that makes each sip smooth and satisfying. HBC 1019 brings vibrant stone fruit and light melon&lt;br&gt;notes, all backed by low bitterness for an easygoing, fruit-forward profile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Light-medium body with a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Soft carbonation keeps it crisp without getting in the way. At 5% ABV, this beer is super crushable—especially as the weather warms up.
