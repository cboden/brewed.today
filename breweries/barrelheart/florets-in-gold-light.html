We brewed some barrels of assertively hopped beer using old-world hop varieties, Czech Saaz and German Tettnang. &lt;br&gt;The resulting barrels display a firm bitterness, with woodsy, spicy and floral hop aromatics, without any acidification during their time in barrels. Our usual Brettanomyces aromatics of citrus and barnyard have been suppressed, but not entirely absent, and we predict these will develop elegantly over time in the bottle. &lt;br&gt;Yarrow flowers have been used in brewing for thousands of years before the discovery of hops, and we were lucky to harvest these from our friends Svava and Mark’s farm, at Concession Gardens. Yarrow has a floral and herbaceous aroma with notes of sage and mint that integrates well into the hop aromatics. &lt;br&gt;The resulting beer is an easy 5.0% ABV, with a proud cap of pillowy white mousse, cleansing bitterness and a bone-dry finish. This may be similar to beers historically brewed in central Europe over 600 years ago. &lt;br&gt;Serving Suggestions: We recommend aggressively pouring this beer to create lots of foam, and allowing the foam to settle before topping the glass with more beer, until the glass is full with proud peaks of foam on top."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://brewed.today/8a41c2b63b51b94ad28b2deab64055cb.6ee3973b.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://brewed.today/breweries/barrelheart/florets-in-gold-light"><meta property="og:title" content="brewed.today - Florets in Gold Light"><meta property="og:description" content="Florets in Gold Light | 5.0% | 750ml&lt;br&gt;The magic hour slant through cracks in the forest, on tiny flowers of yarrow, stretching upward by the meadow&#39;s edge, a bloom of sweet florets, in gold light. &lt;br&gt;Process &amp; tasting notes: This saison is a blend of aged and fresh beer, lagered over the winter, and infused with local yarrow flowers and European hops. &lt;br&gt;Our house culture is known for expressing hay, honey and lime zest notes when the beer has a low bitterness.
