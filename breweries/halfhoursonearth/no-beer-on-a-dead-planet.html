Mixed fermentation Saison, stainless-aged for four months. Brewed with additions of wheat and oats. Hopped with Hallertau Mittelfruh, Opal, and Styrian Golding. This is the type of Saison that got us into Saisons. Noble hop aromatics, earthy, floral, hay, and spice. Pronounced bitterness, crisp, and dry. Notes of lemon, honey, pepper, and subtle Brettanomyces funk. Overall, an effervescent classic pale Saison. FYI, barley, wheat, hops, etc require healthy, fertile soil and a stable climate to grow. Fertile soil is being lost at a rate of 24 billion tonnes a year from unsustainable agriculture. While climate change-induced weather patterns aren‚Äôt making it any easier for crop yields.
