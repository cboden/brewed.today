We mashed in on this with a toasty Maris Otter base, loaded it with malted &amp; flaked oats, and completed the grain bill with just the right amount of chocolate malts. Generously hopped with both East Kent Goldings and Saaz making for a nice little Mild. Then it gets a bit funkier. This a barrel fermented &amp; barrel aged beer in neutral oak. We fermented with a wide variety of yeasts; English Ale yeast, German Lager yeast, Belgian Saison yeast, plus a mixed culture of microbes previously inoculated in the barrels. So many species!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pours amber&#x2F;brown with a thick tan head. Aromatics of citrusy light roast coffee, cocoa, subtle barnyard funk. With flavours of chocolate, caramel, tart cherries with a soft acidity throughout. Dry &amp; crisp, ever so quenchable. We‚Äôre looking forward to enjoying this one with the cool nights ahead!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Available in both 750 ml &amp; 375 ml bottles, with 50 cents of each bottle sold being donated to @wwfcanada for their vision in building a future in which people &amp; nature thrive.
