This well-balanced European-style amber ale is the flagship to our Heritage Series. Reminiscent of our time as an early nation, we have held true to the big bodied, high ABV ales that were very popular among the hard-working men and women who helped Canada become what it is today.
Tasting Notes
Full bodied with a complex malt profile. Velvety and subtle. Notes of rye bread, cheery, and toast, with a warm highland whiskey finish.
