May we present to you Turbo Chop West Coast IPA. Brewed in true West Coast fashion with continual kettle hopping of Simcoe, Cascade and Chinook and HEAVILY dry hopped with Simcoe, Cascade, Centennial and Amarillo. Fermented with California Ale yeast, the OG craft beer yeast and finishing dry at 7% for those seven rascally years we’ve been contributing to the craft beer landscape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This beer is bitter, clear and oh so hoppy. It’s either what got you into craft beer or what you missed when you were still drinking rootbeer. Here’s your chance to go down memory lane or gain an appreciation for what craft beer at its best can be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name? Turbo Chop is a reference to a certain killer Portuguese karate move that is both feared and revered from the Eastbound staff.
